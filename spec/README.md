# Project Specifications

This folder contains project specifications and templates (spec-kit-plus style) for feature design, API contracts, data models, and architecture decisions.

- `SPEC-KIT-PLUS.md`: Quick guide to the included spec-kit-plus templates.
- `naming-conventions.md`: Project naming conventions (copied from `.specify`).
- `templates/`: Reusable spec templates (feature, API, etc.).
- `adr/`: Architecture Decision Records.

How to use

- Copy a template from `templates/` and fill it out for your feature or API.
- Add ADRs in `adr/` to record important architectural decisions.
- Keep `naming-conventions.md` up to date when conventions change.

If you want other templates added (e.g., security spec, performance testing spec), tell me and I will add them.
